We show how to convert regular keyboard-entry CAPTCHAs into clickable CAPTCHAs. The goal of this conversion is to simplify and speed-up the entry of the CAPTCHA so- lution, to minimize user frustration and permit the use of CAPTCHAs on devices where they would otherwise be un- suitable. We propose a technique for producing secure click- able CAPTCHAs that are well suited for use on cell phones and other mobile devices. We support the practical viability of our approach by results from a user study, and an analysis of its security guarantees.
