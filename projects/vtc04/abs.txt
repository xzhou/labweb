In this position paper we discuss various issues related to so-called stealth attacks. We elaborate on stealth attacks in the context of three common types of wireless networks, namely ad hoc networks, hybrid networks, and sensor networks. We consider the relevance of these settings to various vehicular environments; e.g., emergency and rescue operations, military operations, and theft recovery. Along with this, we discuss adversarial models. We furthermore explore the level of threat in a set of example situations and discuss potential tools that could be used to reduce the severity of stealth attacks in these contexts.
