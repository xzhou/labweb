							<h3>Mitigating Inadvertent Insider Threats with Incentives</h3>
							<p>
							<span class="author">D. Liu, L. Jean Camp and X. Wang.<span class="conference"> In the Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on  Financial Cryptography and Data Security (FC) 2009</span></span><br />
							D. Liu, L. Jean Camp and X. Wang,
							Inadvertent insiders are trusted insiders who do not have malicious intent (as with malicious insiders) but do not responsibly managing security. The result is often enabling a malicious outsider to use the privileges of the inattentive insider to implement an insider attack. This risk is as old as conversion of a weak user password into root access, but the term inadvertent insider is recently coined to identify the link between the behavior and the vulnerability. In this paper, we propose to mitigate this threat using a novel risk budget mechanism that offers incentives to an insider to behave according to the risk posture set by the organization. We propose assigning an insider a risk budget, which is a specific allocation of risk points, allowing employees to take a finite number of risk-seeking choice. In this way, the employee can complete her tasks without subverting the security system, as with absolute prohibitions. In the end, the organization penalizes the insider if she fails to accomplish her task within the budget while rewards her in the presence of a surplus. Most importantly. the risk budget requires that the user make conscious visible choices to take electronic risks. We describe the theory behind the system, including specific work on the insider threats. We evaluated this approach using human-subject experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our risk budget mechanism. We also present a game theoretic analysis of the mechanism.</p>

							<h3>Stealth Attacks on Vehicular Wireless Networks</h3>
							<p>
							<span class="author">M. Jakobosson, X. Wang and S. Wetzel.<span class="conference"> In Proceedings of IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference 2004-Fall</span></span><br />
							In this position paper we discuss various issues related to so-called stealth attacks. We elaborate on stealth attacks in the context of three common types of wireless networks, namely ad hoc networks, hybrid networks, and sensor networks. We consider the relevance of these settings to various vehicular environments; e.g., emergency and rescue operations, military operations, and theft recovery. Along with this, we discuss adversarial models. We furthermore explore the level of threat in a set of example situations and discuss potential tools that could be used to reduce the severity of stealth attacks in these contexts.</p>

							<h3>Learning Near-Pareto-Optimal Conventions in Polynomial Time</h3>
							<p>
							<span class="author">X. Wang and T.Sandholm.<span class="conference"> In Proceedings of the 17th Neural Information Processing Systems: Natural and Synthetic conference 2003</span></span><br />
							We study how to learn to play a Pareto-optimal strict Nash equilibrium when there exist multiple equilibria and agents may have different preferences among the equilibria. We focus on repeated coordination games of non-identical interest where agents do not know the game structure up front and receive noisy payoffs. We design efficient near-optimal algorithms for both the perfect monitoring and the imperfect monitoring setting(where the agents only observe their own payoffs and the joint actions).</p>

							<h3>Reinforcement Learning to Play an Optimal Nash Equilibrium in Team Markov Games</h3>
							<p>
							<span class="author">X. Wang and T. Sandholm.<span class="conference"> In Proceedings of the 17th Neural Information Processing Systems: Natural and Synthetic conference 2002</span></span><br />
							Multiagent learning is a key problem in AI. In the presence of multiple Nash equilibria, even agents with non-conflicting interests may not be able to learn an optimal coordination policy. The problem is exaccerbated if the agents do not know the game and independently receive noisy payoffs. So, multiagent reinforfcement learning involves two interrelated problems: identifying the game and learning to play. In this paper, we present optimal adaptive learning, the first algorithm that converges to an optimal Nash equilibrium with probability 1 in any team Markov game. We provide a convergence proof, and show that the algorithm’s parameters are easy to set to meet the convergence conditions.</p>

							<h3>(Im)possibility of Safe Exchange Mechanism Design</h3>
							<p>
							<span class="author">T. Sandholm  and X. Wang.<span class="conference"> (Im)possibility of Safe Exchange Mechanism Design </span></span><br />
							Safe exchange is a key issue in multiagent systems, especially in electronic transactions where nondelivery is a major problem. In this paper we present a unified framework for modeling safe exchange mechanisms. It captures the disparate earlier approaches as well as new safe exchange mechanisms (e.g., reputation locking). Being an overarching framework, it also allows us to study what is inherently possible and impossible in safe exchange. We study this under different game-theoretic solution concepts, with and without a trusted third party, and with an offline third party that only gets involved if the exchange fails. The results vary based on the generality of the exchange setting, the existence (or creative construction) of special types of items to be exchanged, and the magnitude of transfer costs, defection costs, and escrow fees. Finally, we present an incentive-compatible negotiation protocol for selecting the best safe exchange mechanism when the agents do not know each others’ costs for the different alternatives.</p>
