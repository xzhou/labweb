							<h3>WRAPS: Denial-of-Service Defense through Web Referrals</h3>
							<p>
							<span class="author">X. Wang and M. Reiter.<span class="conference">In Proceedings of the 25th  IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems 2006</span></span><br />
							The web is a complicated graph, with millions of websites interlinked together. In this paper, we propose to use this web sitegraph structure to mitigate flooding attacks on a website, using a new web referral architecture for privileged service (“WRAPS”). WRAPS allows a legitimate client to obtain a privilegeURL through a click on a referral hypherlink, from a website trusted by the target website. Using that URL, the client can get privileged access to the target website in a manner that is far less vulnerable to a DDoS flooding attack. WRAPS does not require changes to web client software and is extremely lightweight for referrer websites, which eases its deployment. The massive scale of the web sitegraph could deter attempts to isolate a website through blocking all referrers. We present the design of WRAPS, and the implementation of a prototype system used to evaluate our proposal. Our empirical study demonstrates that WRAPS enables legitimate clients to connect to a website smoothly in spite of an intensive flooding attack, at the cost of small overheads on the website’s ISP’s edge routers.</p>

							<h3>Denial of Service Attacks and Defenses in Decentralized Trust Management</h3>
							<p>
							<span class="author">J. Li, N. Li, X. Wang, and T. Yu. <span class="conference">In Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Security and Privacy in Communication Networks 2006</span></span><br />
							Trust management is an approach to scalable and flexible access control in decentralized systems. In trust management, a server often needs to evaluate a chain of credentials submitted by a client; this requires the server to perform multiple expensive digital signature verifications. In this paper, we study low-bandwidth Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks that exploit the existence of trust management systems to deplete server resources. Although the threat of DoS attacks has been studied for some application-level protocols such as authentication protocols, we show that it is especially destructive for trust management systems. Exploiting the delegation feature in trust management languages, an attacker can forge a long credential chain to force a server to consume a large amount of computing resource. Using game theory as an analytic tool, we demonstrate that unprotected trust management servers will easily fall prey to a witty attacker who moves smartly. We report our empirical study of existing trust management systems, which manifests the gravity of this threat. We also propose a defense technique using credential caching, and show that it is effective in the presence of intelligent attackers.</p>

							<h3>Fragile Mixing</h3>
							<p>
							<span class="author">M. Reiter, X. Wang. <span class="conference"> In Proceedings of 11th ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security (CCS 2004)</span></span><br />
							No matter how well designed and engineered, a mix server offers little protection if its administrator can be convinced to log and selectively disclose correspondences between its input and output messages, either for profit or to cooperate with an investigation. In this paper we propose a technique, fragile mixing, to discourage an administrator from revealing such correspondences, assuming he is motivated to protect the unlinkability of other communications that flow through the mix (e.g., his own). Briefly, fragile mixing implements the property that any disclosure of an input-message-tooutput- message correspondence discloses all such correspondences for that batch of output messages. We detail this technique in the context of a re-encryption mix, its integration with a mix network, and incentive and efficiency issues.</p>

							<h3>Defending Against Denial-of-Service Attacks with Puzzle Auctions</h3>
							<p>
							<span class="author">X. Wang and M.K. Reiter. <span class="conference">In Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2004</span></span><br />
							
							Although client puzzles represent a promising approach to defend against certain classes of denial-of-service attacks, several questions stand in the way of their deployment in practice: e.g., how to set the puzzle difficulty in the presence of an adversary with unknown computing power, and how to integrate the approach with existing mechanisms. In this paper, we attempt to address these questions with a new puzzle mechanism called the puzzle auction. Our mechanism enables each client to "bid" for resources by tuning the difficulty of the puzzles it solves, and to adapt its bidding strategy in response to apparent attacks. We analyze the effectiveness of our auction mechanism and further demonstrate it using an implementation within the TCP protocol stack of the Linux kernel. Our implementation has several appealing properties. It effectively defends against SYN flooding attacks, is fully compatible with TCP, and even provides a degree of interoperability with clients with unmodified kernels: Even without a puzzle-solving kernel, a client still can connect to a puzzle auction server under attack (albeit less effectively than those with puzzle-solving kernels, and at the cost of additional server expense).</p>
