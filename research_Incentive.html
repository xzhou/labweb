							<h3>Mitigating Inadvertent Insider Threats with Incentives</h3>
							<p>
							<span class="author">D. Liu, L. Jean Camp and X. Wang.<span class="conference"> In the Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on  Financial Cryptography and Data Security (FC) 2009</span></span><br />
							D. Liu, L. Jean Camp and X. Wang,
							Inadvertent insiders are trusted insiders who do not have malicious intent (as with malicious insiders) but do not responsibly managing security. The result is often enabling a malicious outsider to use the privileges of the inattentive insider to implement an insider attack. This risk is as old as conversion of a weak user password into root access, but the term inadvertent insider is recently coined to identify the link between the behavior and the vulnerability. In this paper, we propose to mitigate this threat using a novel risk budget mechanism that offers incentives to an insider to behave according to the risk posture set by the organization. We propose assigning an insider a risk budget, which is a specific allocation of risk points, allowing employees to take a finite number of risk-seeking choice. In this way, the employee can complete her tasks without subverting the security system, as with absolute prohibitions. In the end, the organization penalizes the insider if she fails to accomplish her task within the budget while rewards her in the presence of a surplus. Most importantly. the risk budget requires that the user make conscious visible choices to take electronic risks. We describe the theory behind the system, including specific work on the insider threats. We evaluated this approach using human-subject experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our risk budget mechanism. We also present a game theoretic analysis of the mechanism.</p>

							<h3>Deterring Voluntary Trace Disclosure in Re-encryption Mix Networks</h3>
							<p>
							<span class="author">P. Golle, X. Wang, M. Jakobsson and A. Tsow.<span class="conference">In Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2006</span></span><br />
							
							An all too real threat to the privacy offered by a mix network is that individual mix administrators may volunteer partial tracing information to a coercer. While this threat can never be eliminated – coerced mix servers could simply be forced to reveal all their secret data – we can deter administrators from succumbing to coercive attacks by raising the stakes. We introduce the notion of a trace-deterring mix permutation to guarantee privacy, and show how it ensures that a collateral key (used for an arbitrary purpose) be automatically revealed given any end-to-end trace from input to output elements. However, no keying material is revealed to a party who simply knows what input element corresponds to what output element. Our techniques are sufficiently efficient to be deployed in large-scale elections, thereby providing a sort of publicly verifiable privacy guarantee. Their impact on the size of the anonymity set – while quantifiable – are not of practical concern.</p>

							<h3>Building Reliable Mix Networks with Fair Exchange</h3>
							<p>
							<span class="author">M. Reiter, X. Wang and M. Wright.<span class="conference">In Proceedings of the 3th International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security (ACNS) 2005</span></span><br />
							
							In this paper we present techniques by which each mix in a mix network can be paid for its services by message senders, in a way that ensures fairness and without sacrificing anonymity. We describe a payment mechanism for use in mix networks, and use this payment scheme in fair exchange mechanisms for both connection-based and messagebased mix networks. In connection-based mix networks, our protocols achieve fairness in a weak sense: no player can benefit from stopping the exchange prematurely. In message-based mix networks, by taking advantage of each mix’s next-hop neighbor as a rational third party, our exchange protocol guarantees strict fairness between initiators and mixes: either both parties successfully exchange payment and service or neither gains anything.</p>
