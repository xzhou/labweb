							<h2>Incnetive Engineering</h2>
							<h3>Deterring Voluntary Trace Disclosure in Re-encryption Mix Networks</h3>
							<p>An all too real threat to the privacy offered by a mix network is that individual mix administrators may volunteer partial tracing information to a coercer. While this threat can never be eliminated – coerced mix servers could simply be forced to reveal all their secret data – we can deter administrators from succumbing to coercive attacks by raising the stakes. We introduce the notion of a trace-deterring mix permutation to guarantee privacy, and show how it ensures that a collateral key (used for an arbitrary purpose) be automatically revealed given any end-to-end trace from input to output elements. However, no keying material is revealed to a party who simply knows what input element corresponds to what output element. Our techniques are sufficiently efficient to be deployed in large-scale elections, thereby providing a sort of publicly verifiable privacy guarantee. Their impact on the size of the anonymity set – while quantifiable – are not of practical concern.</p>
							
							<h3>Building Reliable Mix Networks with Fair Exchange</h3>
							<p>In this paper we present techniques by which each mix in a mix network can be paid for its services by message senders, in a way that ensures fairness and without sacrificing anonymity. We describe a payment mechanism for use in mix networks, and use this payment scheme in fair exchange mechanisms for both connection-based and messagebased mix networks. In connection-based mix networks, our protocols achieve fairness in a weak sense: no player can benefit from stopping the exchange prematurely. In message-based mix networks, by taking advantage of each mix’s next-hop neighbor as a rational third party, our exchange protocol guarantees strict fairness between initiators and mixes: either both parties successfully exchange payment and service or neither gains anything.</p>
